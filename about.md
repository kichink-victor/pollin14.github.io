## My story

I have always liked the technology, mainly, those in video game consoles. My favorite reads were about technical specifications. When I was 16 year, I entered to workshop of Computation at the high school, there, I learned the logic to programming and discovery the marvel recursion. For myself I learned Java, JavaScript, VBScript and Flash 5.

So, I chose to study mathematics at Science Faculty of the UNAM with a approach in the computer science to be a better software developer. Thanks to my previous studies in programming I approved easily the course that required implement some program, about the half of these. My favorite course was Languages of Programing and its paradigms. In the course I learned the essence of the programming languages and my favorite paradigm was "the functional".

I like to write clean, readable and maintainable code. I take pride in code.
